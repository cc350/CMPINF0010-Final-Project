##### Introduction and Metric Explanation
##### Our goal with this project was to find the “best” neighborhood in Pittsburgh, based on the datasets we selected from the WPRDC. The datasets we selected were public water features and walkability. For each metric, we ranked each of the 65 neighborhoods in Pittsburgh on a scale up to 100. Then, to find an overall “best” neighborhood, we combined the two scores together, weighting the walkability score as 70% of the overall score and the water features score as 30%. We chose to weight the walkability score higher because it measures the people in the neighborhood’s to access multiple amenities without a car, rather than just their access to water-based amenities. 
##### The motivation for choosing public water features as a dataset is that they provide both practical and visual appeal to a neighborhood. Drinking fountains allow people to stay hydrated as they walk or jog around their neighborhoods for exercise. Public “spray” features – or fountains designed for people to run through – provide entertainment and joy for children in parks over the summer. Decorative fountains add beauty to a neighborhood year-round, whether water is running from them or they are shut off and covered in snow for the winter.  
##### _______motivation and context for walkability________.
